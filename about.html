  <p itemprop="description"  class="about-p">My name is Celena Dick — middle name Stefanie — and I love to create! I'm currently a third year student from Algonquin College studying Graphic Design.
    Ever since I was younger I was always doing something artistic whether it be drawing, painting or collaging. With a closet full of magazine scraps and art supplies, I still to this day continue to practice what I love.
    Apart from art, I'm a full time animal lover with two cats and the memory of the sweetest hedgehog. I will pet any dog that I cross paths with and dog sit in my free time! Music also plays a huge part in inspiring my personal work so feel free to figure out what I was listening to when looking through my projects.
    Throughout my time at Algonquin, I further developped my skills in <b>Illustration, Typography, Print, UX/UI </b> and a little bit of <b>Web Design!</b></p>
