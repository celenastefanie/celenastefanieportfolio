        <p>Along with hand drawn illustrations, I have spent the last couple years tinkering with digital artwork. By painting in Illustrator and Photoshop, I've been able to expand my horizons and create new and interesting pieces that can be used for artwork in a multitude of projects. Shown here is The Lip Print. With my own handmade illustrator brushes, I painted these lips pixel by pixel in a cross-stitched pattern giving it a very organic style. Each pixel was swatched and individually painted creating a 12 by 18 print that I have used as artwork for editorial work and wall art.</p>
