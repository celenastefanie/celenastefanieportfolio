  <h3>REBRANDING</h3>
    <h4>Adorit Boutique</h4>
      <h5 itemprop="dateCreated">Spring 2016</h5>
      <div class="project-des">
        <p>Adorit is an Ottawa based boutique specializing in fair trade and environmentally friendly products. Stock ranges from jewelry and clothing to henna paste and incense. Through research establishing target audience, current versus desired perceoption and competition, the key message became clear: Adorit is an environmentally friendly, fair trade boutique that showcases pieces from designers not only from here in Ottawa, but from around the world.
            This key message also brought to light the unique selling point that would be taken into consideration during the sketching phase.

          <br>
          After 3 rounds of sketching, two logo designs were chosen and 1 was used to create a full branding guide for Adorit Boutique outlining window treatmeants, packaging, buffer zones, etc.  </p>
