  <h3>MOVIE REDESIGN</h3>
    <h4>Seven Pounds</h4>
      <h5 itemprop="dateCreated">Fall 2015</h5>
      <div class="project-des">
        <p>I chose to redesign the movie poster for Seven Pounds, a dark and symbolic film playing on themes of loss, guilt, love and redemption. The original movie poster features star Will Smith accompaigned by the names of lives he decides to change and the film title in simple serif type.
          Although dramatic and attention grabbing, this poster in my opinion does not do the film justice. Upon rewatching it and realizing the attention to cinematography and art direction, I chose to concentrate my redesign around the symbolic bathtub scene.
          The tile, faucet, tub, water, hands, and jellyfish were all seperate photos non-destructively edited together through Photoshop. Adjustments and masks were used to recreate the dark and bruding atmosphere. I reworked the serif typeface, using blue as the attention grabbing complimentary colour.
          Overall, I feel this redesign expresses the themes and feeling of the movie more so than the original movie poster did. It provokes thought and mimics the same intensity that the film itself portrays.

          Paired with the movie poster, a vinyl album cover was designed with spot varnish to complete the movie redesign. This vinyl cover practically screams "caution: dark and emotional music ahead" whereas a vinyl cover adapted from the original movie poster would just seem like another movie soundtrack.
          The title as well as the jellyfish share the same glossy varnish, bringing the bright blues to life and providing even more visual interest.
