  <h3>CAMPAIGN</h3>
    <h4>The Ottawa RedBlacks</h4>
      <h5 itemprop="dateCreated">Fall 2015</h5>
      <p class="project-des">In order to increase ticket sales for the Ottawa RedBlacks, I designed a campaign to sell a family ticket pack. My concept for this campaign was bringing the family together – Get Closer – and illustrated this concept in different ways to convey the message. Each image communicates the feeling of unity and togetherness, the same feeling you feel when with your family/team. To appeal to families, imagery and text conformed to a juvenile, cartoonish feel while still conveying the intesity of the sport through bright colours and a bukly header font.
      Along with print advertisements, web banners, outdoor advertisments and a facebook timeline banner were created. </p>
