        <p>A big part of what makes my little creative heart happy are the illustrations I can do in my spare time. I enjoy different styles and different subjects but almost always stray back to my fine tip black pen and my handy Dr. Martins Ink Watercolour set. The contrast between the messy, colourful splashes and a refined black and white illustration are what drive most of my work.
        I'm on multiple designed product platflorms such as redbubble and society6, and intend on expanding my illustration business in the future!</p>
