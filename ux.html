    <h4>Animal Talk</h4>

      <div class="project-des">
        <p>Animal Talk solves a common problem almost every pet owner faces on a day to day basis - the language barrier between animal and man. As a animal lover and cat owner, I was inspired by my own pets to reach out to others and ask how they feel about communicating to their pets. Through questionaires, I was able to draw a few conclusions; that pet owners have a strong emotional response when unable to understand their pets, that they place an importance on their bond with their pet and lastly, that they actually talk back to their pets.
          With a problem statement and a concept beneficial to the target audience, I began creating an app with 2 key features: the ability to translate animal speech and the ability to talk back. Users can switch between cat and dog, set setting preferences, and overall enjoy the experience of using the app.

          After two rounds of usability testing, solutions to problems were found and the art direction for Animal Talk took off. It provides a meaningful experience to animal lovers around the world, giving them a chance to communicate to their furry friends. It proves useful in situations when your pet is in pain, acting unsual, or just in need of a little TLC.</p>
