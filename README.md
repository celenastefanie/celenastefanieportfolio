Hello! I am a graphic design student at Algonquin College. I love to create both on the computer and physical pieces. I experiment with watercolour, illustration, UX/UI, motion, and many more!

Before college, most of my time was spent doodling so it only seemed fit that I incorporate this aspect of my life into my field of study. I draw inspiration from music, life experiences (both happy and sad), and animals so feel free to guess which tune I was listening to as you scroll through my portfolio!
